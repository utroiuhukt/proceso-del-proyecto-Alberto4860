========================
In the text we could read the context of what happened to the little baby Theresa, what their parents decided to do
when they knew of the little ́s child fate and what the opinion of the people was, it was written what the ethicist 
opinion on the matter was in their point of view. “killing a person in favor of other is wrong”, “doing what was 
thought of is wrong” while the parents and doctors had a different opinion, thinking more of what was best for the 
other children in need of the organs that could save their lives, and in the end, how not even them could be saved due 
to not being able to receive the transplant in time.

In the end and in my opinion, while it can be a not so popular opinion, the term “Right” and “Wrong” is ultimately based 
on one's perspective, for ones what they wanted to do with the little Theresa was “Wrong, because killing anyone is bad, 
for any cause whatsoever”, clearly having an opinion of care for all living life and a moral duty to protect and preserve 
all. While the other side had an opinion of “Right, because with the organ we can save other lives”, this side mirroring in 
certain way what the other side ́s opinion was, but having resigned to the fate of the little one thinking of using her organs 
to save the ones that can be saved. At the end the ethical opinion of any person depends on their way of thinking and it can 
be concluded that we as individuals will never reach a common ground with anyone.

And to end this manuscript, my opinion on the matter is that the option of using little Theresa ́s organs to save the other 
children in need was correct because it could be seen as a way to let the little girl live on although in other way, also 
thanks to her condition even if she was let to live more, that could not be considered as “living” caus one can only live as 
they grow and experiment what life gives them, that is living, not simply existing.
